    <p class="pp"> SAVOUR: But with Soji its different right? With him there's no fear,no lingering threat in the dark.
        With
        him there's security,there's safety.He's not just a man- he's your brother,the one who stands between you
        and the world,who shields you from the chaos that tries to seep in. With Soji,you dont have to keep your
        guard up. You can just be. Your little reminder that some can be protectors in a world where men are
        destroyers. Soji is your proof that even in a world that feels so unsafe there are still people that would
        fight for you,who would stand by you no matter what.He's the calm in the storm,the steady hand that holds
        yours when it feels like everything else is falling apart. Find your Soji. </p>
